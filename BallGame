========
Hunter Gilliam
	Ball bounce requirements
	User input/drawing
	ball	
	ball bounces
	bounds of the project/screen
	ball bounces off newly formed objects made by the user
	mouse control
	some sort of way to start/end
	is this a game?- is there some kind of objective?- scoring?
	How big is the ball?- How fast should the ball move?- How long should the game last(ifgame)
	what operating system?- budget? - who is this program for?
	Is this already a created thing?- If so what do we need to change to make this one different?


In this weeks status report discuss how we scoped out the work last thursday in order to complete it in time.
	We broke down and focused on each task one by one in order to more efficiently complete the assignment.
